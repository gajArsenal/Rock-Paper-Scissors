# Rock/Paper/Scissors Game

2 Player Game

Game keeps point system (3 points for win, 1 for tie, 0 for loss)

If a player achieves '9 results' in one category (either win, loss or tie) the season is labeled as ending.

At the end of a season, the computer determines who the winner is by displaying the point standings (for example,
if a player has 9 wins and 2 ties that will result in 29 points overall).

If one of the users quits the game during their turn, the file will save the the current points (and will clear the points
at the end of the season).
